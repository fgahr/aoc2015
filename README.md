# My Attempt for Advent of Code 2015 (in Python)
I haven't done much with Python yet so this is just some practice. I do in no way claim that any of this is expertly written. On the contrary, some solutions are deliberately over-engineered to familiarize myself with some language features.

I started this in 2019, not 2015.

To recreate the results, add your puzzle input for each day in a file named `input.txt` in the corresponding day's subfolder and run the `dayN.py` executable there. As far as I can tell, any python 3.7 installation should suffice, no extra libraries required.
